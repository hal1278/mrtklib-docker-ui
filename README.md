# MRTKLIB Web UI

A modern web-based user interface for [MRTKLIB](https://github.com/h-shiono/MRTKLIB),
supported through Docker and Nix workflows. MRTKLIB is a modernized C11
implementation of RTKLIB with MADOCA-PPP, CLAS PPP-RTK, and advanced
GNSS positioning capabilities. The Docker path remains available, and
the repository now also exposes a flake-based `nix develop` / `nix run`
workflow for Linux.

## Workflow Status

- Supported runtime workflows:
  `docker compose` and `nix run .`
- Local editable development:
  backend with `uv`, frontend with `npm`, optionally from `nix develop`
- Nix validation status:
  verified in the current worktree on `x86_64-linux`; remaining scope notes are tracked in [`docs/nix-plan.md`](./docs/nix-plan.md)

## Features

### Post Processing (`mrtk post`)
- Sidebar navigation covering all MRTKLIB configuration options
  (Positioning: Mode / Method / PPP-MADOCA / CLAS PPP-RTK / AR /
  Kalman Filter; Station; Misc: Output Format / Input Options /
  Data Files / Server)
- Full TOML configuration import / export
- Named preset management (saved to `/workspace/presets/`)
- Support for all positioning modes: Single, DGPS, Kinematic,
  Static, PPP-Kinematic, PPP-Static, PPP-AR, CLAS PPP-RTK,
  MADOCA PPP, VRS-RTK
- Result visualization: 2D E/N scatter, interactive basemap (Leaflet),
  and position / quality charts — reads **LLH, XYZ-ECEF, and NMEA-0183**
  solution outputs (auto-detected)

### Real-Time Positioning (`mrtk run`)
- Live position display (Lat / Lon / Height / AR Ratio /
  Satellites / Age / GPST)
- Fix quality badges: FIXED / FLOAT / SINGLE color-coded
- **2D** E/N scatter (1:1 aspect ratio, quality colors) and a live
  **Map** view on a real basemap (Leaflet), shown individually or
  side by side
- Time series chart
- Sky plot + SNR bar chart (per-constellation color coding,
  used/unused satellite highlighting)
- Solution and trace output streaming

### Stream Relay (`mrtk relay`)
- Multi-stream configuration (up to 4 simultaneous streams)
- Per-stream Start / Stop control with live console output

### CLAS Pipeline (`mrtk relay` + `mrtk cssr2rtcm3`)
- One-form Wizard for the SBC + receiver + CLAS workflow using
  MRTKLIB v0.7.6
- Pipes Septentrio SBF (with QZSS L6 CLAS) → cssr2rtcm3 → RTCM3 →
  back to the receiver, which runs VRS-RTK on its own engine
- Live throughput meter, position scatter (parsed from SBF
  PVTGeodetic), and split logs for both child processes
- Currently ships with a mosaic-G5 preset; request more receivers
  via the GitHub Issue template

### RINEX Conversion (`mrtk convert`)
- Supports all convbin formats: u-blox, Septentrio SBF,
  NovAtel, BINEX, Trimble RT17, RTCM2/3, RINEX re-processing
- Collapsible option groups (Time Range, Signal Options,
  RINEX Header, Debug)
- Live command preview before execution
- RINEX file preview after conversion (header + first 5–10 epochs)

### Receiver Monitor (NMEA / UBX / SBF)
- Direct connection to GNSS receiver without invoking `mrtk run`
- Parses NMEA GGA/RMC, UBX NAV-PVT, SBF PVTGeodetic
- Live position visualization identical to Real-Time tab
- Raw data file logging to `/workspace/logs/`

### Tools
- **GNSS Time Converter**: fully bidirectional conversion between
  Calendar/UTC, GPS Week/ToW, and Day of Year/Session
- **Data Downloader**: QZSS L6D (CLAS) and L6E (MADOCA) file
  download; IGS atx update; IGS products and GSI CORS data
  (NASA Earthdata and GSI credentials required for the latter two)

### Configuration & Workflow
- Two-volume Docker setup: `/workspace` (read-write) and
  `/data` (read-only host data directory)
- Server-side preset management with import / export
- TOML import with lossless round-trip (unknown keys preserved)
- IBM Plex Sans + IBM Plex Mono typography
- Dark / light mode toggle

## Getting Started

Choose either the Docker workflow or the Nix workflow.

### Docker Prerequisites

- Docker (the **Build from source** flow additionally uses
  `docker compose`, which ships with Docker Desktop)
- GNSS data files (RINEX observation and navigation files)

### Quick Start (pre-built image)

The fastest way to try MRTKLIB Web UI. No cloning or building required.

Images are published for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
(Apple Silicon native).

1. **Pull the image**
   ```bash
   # Docker Hub
   docker pull hatognss/mrtklib-docker-ui:0.3.0-alpha

   # or GitHub Container Registry
   docker pull ghcr.io/h-shiono/mrtklib-docker-ui:0.3.0-alpha
   ```

2. **Prepare host directories**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./workspace ./data
   # Place your GNSS data files under ./data (read-only in container)
   ```

3. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name mrtklib-web-ui \
     -p 8080:8000 \
     -v "$(pwd)/workspace:/workspace:rw" \
     -v "$(pwd)/data:/data:ro" \
     hatognss/mrtklib-docker-ui:0.3.0-alpha
   ```

4. **Open the UI** at <http://localhost:8080>

Published images:

| Registry | Repository |
|---|---|
| Docker Hub | [`hatognss/mrtklib-docker-ui`](https://hub.docker.com/r/hatognss/mrtklib-docker-ui) |
| GHCR | [`ghcr.io/h-shiono/mrtklib-docker-ui`](https://github.com/h-shiono/mrtklib-docker-ui/pkgs/container/mrtklib-docker-ui) |

Both repositories carry the same multi-arch manifest. See the
repository pages above for the list of available tags.

### Build from source

Use this flow if you need to customise the MRTKLIB version, build
against a local MRTKLIB checkout, or develop the Web UI itself.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/h-shiono/mrtklib-docker-ui.git
   cd mrtklib-docker-ui
   ```

2. **Configure directories**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./workspace ./data
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set DATA_DIR to your GNSS data directory
   ```

3. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. **Open the UI** at <http://localhost:8080>

### Nix Prerequisites

- Nix with flakes enabled
- GNSS data files (RINEX observation and navigation files)

### Nix Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/h-shiono/mrtklib-docker-ui.git
   cd mrtklib-docker-ui
   ```

2. **Start the packaged app**
   ```bash
   nix run .
   ```

3. **Open the UI**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

4. **Optional: enter the dev shell**
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

### Using a local MRTKLIB checkout with Nix

By default, the Nix workflow builds MRTKLIB from the upstream
`github:h-shiono/MRTKLIB/v0.7.6` input declared in `flake.nix`. To build
against a local editable MRTKLIB checkout instead, override that input:

```bash
nix build .#mrtklib \
  --override-input mrtklib-src path:/path/to/MRTKLIB
nix run . \
  --override-input mrtklib-src path:/path/to/MRTKLIB
```

The override is local to the command and does not modify `flake.lock`.

### Data Directory Configuration

| Mount | Default | Purpose | Access |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| `/workspace` | `./workspace` | Output files, presets, logs | Read-write |
| `/data` | `./data` | Input GNSS data files | Read-only |
```bash
# .env
DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/gnss-data
```

### Serial Device Passthrough (Monitor tab and CLAS Pipeline)

To connect to a GNSS receiver via serial port, add the device
to `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  mrtklib-web-ui:
    devices:
      - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
    volumes:
      # Optional: mount /dev/serial so the UI can list ports by descriptor
      # name (e.g. "usb-Septentrio_Mosaic-G5_..." instead of "ttyUSB0").
      - /dev/serial:/dev/serial:ro
```

The CLAS Pipeline tab needs **two** serial devices (one for SBF
input, one for RTCM3 output). Set `CLAS_INPUT_DEVICE` and
`CLAS_OUTPUT_DEVICE` in `.env`, then uncomment the matching
`devices:` block in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### macOS host

Docker Desktop on macOS runs Linux containers in a hidden VM, so
USB-serial devices on the Mac (`/dev/cu.usbmodem*`) are **not**
visible to the container by default. Use one of:

- Run on the SBC itself (recommended for production CLAS use).
- Forward over the network with USB/IP or a TCP↔serial bridge
  (e.g. `socat`, `ser2net`) and pick TCP in the UI instead of
  serial.
- Use a Linux host or VM with native USB device access.

### Credentials (Data Downloader)

The Data Downloader supports three credential sources
(priority order: `.netrc` mount > environment variables > UI):
```bash
# .env
EARTHDATA_USER=your_username    # NASA Earthdata (IGS products)
EARTHDATA_PASSWORD=your_password
GSI_USER=your_username          # GSI CORS FTP
GSI_PASSWORD=your_password
```

QZSS L6D/L6E files require no authentication.

#### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Process Management**: asyncio.subprocess
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic v2

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript

## Development Setup

### Nix Dev Shell

```bash
nix develop
```

The dev shell provides `python`, `uv`, `node`, `cmake`, `git`, and
`mrtk`, and exports runtime paths such as `MRTKLIB_MRTK_BIN`,
`MRTKLIB_WORKSPACE_DIR`, `MRTKLIB_DATA_DIR`, and
`MRTKLIB_SYSTEM_DIR`.

### Backend
```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn mrtklib_web_ui.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

The frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies
API requests to the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Releases & Image Maintenance

### Tag → image mapping

The `publish-docker.yml` workflow is the only thing that pushes
to GHCR / Docker Hub. It runs on two events:

| Trigger | Resulting tags (per registry) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| `git push origin vX.Y.Z[-suffix]` | `X.Y.Z[-suffix]`, `sha-<7-char>`. For non-prerelease tags also `X.Y`, `X`, `latest`. |
| `gh workflow run publish-docker.yml --ref <branch>` | `dev-<branch>` only. Repeated runs **overwrite the same tag** in place — no accumulation. |

So the recommended dev cycle is `gh workflow run --ref my-branch` →
`docker pull ...:dev-my-branch`. Cutting an actual release is
the only way to mint a new long-lived tag.

### Cleaning up GHCR safely

**Do not bulk-delete "untagged" entries** in the GHCR Versions
view. Multi-arch images (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) live as
a tagged manifest list that *references* per-architecture
manifests appearing as untagged digests. Deleting those breaks
`docker pull` for the matching platform with `manifest unknown`.

Safe order if the registry needs a tidy-up:

1. Delete `dev-*` or stale `sha-*` entries that have a tag —
   their referenced platform manifests then drop to true orphans.
2. Wait briefly (or refresh the view) and only then delete the
   now-dereferenced untagged digests.
3. If a release tag does break, `git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z`
   followed by `git push origin vX.Y.Z` re-runs the workflow and
   restores the manifest list. The GitHub Release object
   re-attaches automatically.

The same rule applies to Docker Hub, which is just slower to
surface orphan state in its UI.

## Known Issues

This is an alpha release. Many features have been implemented
but not yet thoroughly tested in real-world conditions.
Bug reports and feedback are very welcome — please
[open an issue](https://github.com/h-shiono/mrtklib-docker-ui/issues).

### Known untested or partially tested areas

- **Real-Time positioning** (`mrtk run`): basic operation confirmed;
  edge cases (stream reconnection, dual-channel CLAS, long runs)
  not yet validated
- **Monitor tab** (NMEA/UBX/SBF): parser logic implemented but
  not tested against real receiver hardware
- **Data Downloader**: QZSS L6D/L6E endpoints implemented;
  IGS products (NASA Earthdata) and GSI CORS (FTP) untested
- **TOML import round-trip**: basic cases work; complex configs
  with all options may have edge cases
- **Configuration option coverage**: UI covers all options from
  the reference, but default values and conditional logic have
  not been exhaustively verified
- **RINEX preview**: implemented but not tested across all
  receiver formats
- **CLAS Pipeline**: uses a single bidirectional serial port; hardware
  passthrough validated only with the mosaic-G5 preset

### Platform notes

- Tested on: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), macOS (Apple Silicon)
- Windows (Docker Desktop): untested

All bug reports are appreciated, including partial or unclear ones.

## Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome — bug reports, feature
requests, documentation improvements, and pull requests.

**The most helpful thing right now is real-world testing.**
If you try MRTKLIB Web UI with your own receiver or dataset
and something does not work as expected, please open an issue.
You do not need to have a fix ready — a clear description of
what happened is enough.

### Opening an Issue

When reporting a bug, please include:

- Which tab / feature was affected
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Browser and OS (and Docker version if relevant)
- Any error messages from the browser console or Docker logs

For feature requests, a brief description of the use case
is more useful than a specific implementation proposal.

### Pull Requests

For small fixes (typos, obvious bugs), a PR is welcome directly.
For larger changes, please open an issue first to discuss
the approach — this avoids duplicated effort.

### Guidelines

- Python: PEP 8, type hints throughout
- TypeScript: strict mode, functional components
- Commits: conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- Do not modify MRTKLIB source code in this repository

---

## Bundled Correction Files

The Docker image includes correction files from MRTKLIB for
quick-start CLAS PPP-RTK and MADOCA PPP processing:

### CLAS PPP-RTK
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `clas_grid.def` | CLAS grid definition |
| `clas_grid.blq` | Ocean tide loading coefficients |
| `igu00p01.erp` | Earth rotation parameters |
| `igs14_L5copy.atx` | Satellite/receiver antenna PCV |
| `isb.tbl` | Inter-system bias table |
| `l2csft.tbl` | L2C signal phase correction |

### MADOCA PPP
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `igs20.atx` | IGS antenna model (satellite + receiver PCO/PCV) |

These files are available at `/opt/mrtklib/corrections/` inside
the container and can be selected directly from the UI's
Files configuration panel. Use the "Apply CLAS PPP-RTK profile"
or "Apply MADOCA PPP profile" buttons to set all paths at once.

To use a newer version of any file, place it in your `/data`
directory and select it manually via the file browser.
